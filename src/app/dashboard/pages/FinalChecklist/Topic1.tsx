                <li>Avoid referring to General Agents or Mercor in your recordings. A good
recording is representative of real-world use cases, and in real-world
scenarios, there are millions of alternatives you can reference instead of
General Agents or Mercor!
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Avoid typos. Although they are not a deal breaker, typos generally reduce
the quality of your recordings. A well-executed recording is crisp and
optimal—aim for that!
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Populating your workspace/accounts – Ask yourself: Is the recording you
are about to execute complex enough? Are the workspaces or accounts
populated sufficiently to emulate a real-world use case?
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Remember: your recordings must include instructional prompts every time,
and annotation prompts should be used when the recording is longer and
more complex, wherein you are doing multiple tasks as a part of one
longer/more complex task.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Prompts should be in the form of commands rather than requests. They
                must be concise and to the point!
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                Add relevant tags to your recordings. Every recording should have at least
two tags: one tool-tag and one op-tool-operation tag. It may include more
than two tags as well.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                Always end your recordings using the shortcut CMD+CTRL+SHIFT+R rather
                than by clicking the &quot;Stop Recording&quot; button on Fluxe.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Ensure that your MacBook is updated to the latest macOS version.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>Install an app like Caffeine, and keep your MacBook on for a while to allow
your recordings to finish uploading. Sometimes, due to slow upload speeds,
some recordings might not be fully uploaded to Engine. To mitigate this, it is
advised to keep your Mac on for a short period after completing your
recordings.</li>
